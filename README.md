# `Reuty's Health Lab - Welcome!`

![](gifs/all.gif)

This project provides some code for learning and testing healing mechanics found across many types of game. The project includes a few different types of health display, like the MMO type profile in the top right, an ARPG 'health bowl' in the bottom left, a heart type system in the center at the bottom, and a standard no-frills health bar in the center.

This project is designed to help you learn how these types of mechanisms can be implemented in games, and particularly how to do it using the Godot engine. Feel free to use this code anywhere you like, crediting [@not_reuty](https://twitter.com/not_reuty) is not required but greatly appreciated!

A huge thank you to [Kenney](https://twitter.com/KenneyNL) for making the assets public, and to the creator of [Komika Title](https://www.dafont.com/komika-title.font) (the font used throughout)!

## `Active Healing`
Active healing comes in many forms, from item pickups, to consumables, spells, and more. This project contains code for three types of active healing, i) consumable heal-over-time, ii) consumable instant heal, and iii) regular instant heal (like an instant cast spell).

Each are slightly different, see below for details;
